## Projects Included

### 1. Password Strength Checker & Hash Storage
- **File:** `password_checker/password_checker.py`  
- **Description:** Checks password strength (length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters) and stores hashed passwords using SHA-256.  
- **Skills demonstrated:** Strings, conditionals, hashing, file handling.

### 2. Network Packet Sniffer (Optional Next Project)
- **File:** `network_sniffer/sniffer.py`  
- **Description:** Captures network packets on a local network and displays headers such as source/destination IP and protocol.  
- **Skills demonstrated:** Networking basics, packet analysis, Python `scapy`.

### 3. Two-Factor Authentication Simulation
- **File:** `two_factor_auth/two_factor.py`  
- **Description:** Generates one-time passwords (OTP) and verifies user input before granting access.  
- **Skills demonstrated:** Random number generation, input validation, authentication concepts.

### 4. File Encryption/Decryption Tool
- **File:** `file_encryption/encrypt_decrypt.py`  
- **Description:** Encrypts and decrypts text files using symmetric encryption (AES or simple cipher).  
- **Skills demonstrated:** Applied cryptography, file handling, secure storage.

### 5. Web Form Vulnerability Demo (Optional)
- **File:** `web_vulnerabilities/` (contains HTML + Python/Flask or PHP)  
- **Description:** Demonstrates safe vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL Injection in a local environment, with secure mitigation.  
- **Skills demonstrated:** Web security, input validation, safe coding practices.
